# Chat Application

## About the Project

This is a **Real-Time Chat Application** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and **Socket.io** for bi-directional communication between clients and the server. The application allows users to join rooms, send messages in real time, and display all active users.
